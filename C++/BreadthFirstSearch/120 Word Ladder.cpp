/*
	Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, 
	find the length of shortest transformation sequence from start to end, such that:
	1. Only one letter can be changed at a time
	2. Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary

	Example
	Given:
	start = "hit"
	end = "cog"
	dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
	As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
	return its length 5.
